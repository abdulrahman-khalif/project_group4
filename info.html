     <p class = "prgragraph"> Cyaneopubescens, also known as the Green Bottle Blue is by far one of the most colourful tarantula species in the hobby. This is a New World, Semi-Arboreal species that is found in Northern Venezuela, at the Northern coast of South America. Although they’re land dwellers that can and sometimes burrow, they also enjoy slightly elevated places which they can climb and use as anchor points to create intricate webbed structures. Hence the ‘semi-arboreal’ categorisation, as it is a terrestrial tarantula with arboreal characteristics. Therefore, this species is quite popular as it is colourful and how it can make stunning web designs. Additionally, this species has a medium growth rate, with the males maturing in around 1.5 years while females will take around 2+ years to mature. 
      However, like all tarantulas, this species possesses venom. Although mild, it still won’t be fun to get bitten by one. Furthermore, like most New World species, they also have urticating hairs in which they can kick at you whenever threatened, which will irritate the skin. This species is more of the “see but not touch” type as they’re not as easy to handle compared to some other species. Although, they are not highly defensive for the most part and would usually choose to run and hide than to fight back, hence why they can be relatively easy to deal with as long as you know what you’re doing. Additionally, this is a hardy species and are relatively easy to care for hence why they can be recommended to beginners.

     <h1 class = "description"> Housing:</h1>
    <p class = "prgragraph">Given that C. cyaneopubescens is a semi-arboreal species, you would want more of a hybrid build between a terrestrial and arboreal setup. A simple design can be done by filling up about 1/3rd of the enclosure with substrate and adding tall anchor points such as cork barks, sticks and anything solid that can hold its place. The goal is to give the spider various opportunities to build webs and climb as this species likes to do.
  For the enclosure size, the length and width should be around 3x the leg span of the spider. Also ensure that there is at least 2x for height to allow it to climb a bit whenever needed.
  This species prefers a more arid environment, so maintaining an internal humidity inside the enclosure of around 50-60% is generally good enough. This can be done by adding a shallow water dish in the enclosure, just ensure that it is cleaned and refilled regularly. Although misting isn’t necessary, it can be done on occasion around the water dish area. Placing and misting Sphagnum Moss on one side in the enclosure can also be used to retain humidity is also a good alternative.
  Like all other tarantula species, it is best to ensure the enclosure is well ventilated as stagnant air can be bad for the tarantula.
Lastly, the entire enclosure should be cleaned every few months. Change the substrate and clean/sanitise any decor.</p>
  

<h2 class = "description"> Feeding:
    </h2>
    <p class = "prgragraph">For slings, it’s recommended to use fruit flies or pre-killed mealworms. However, if you do not have access to small feeders, you can also cut mealworms into pieces and place it on the top of the substrate. Slings can be fed once or twice a week.
        For juveniles and adults, they can also be fed a variety of insect feeders as long as the insect is around the size of the spider’s abdomen. Adults do not need to eat as much as slings/juveniles and can be fed once a week or in two weeks. 
        The size of the feeder should be around the same size of the tarantula’s abdomen, this applies to all tarantula sizes. 
        In general, if the tarantula’s abdomen is really big, they would not require as much food and you can reduce the rate at which you’re feeding them. It could also mean that they are in premoult, and if so avoid feeding the tarantula until successful moult. After moulting, it is best to not feed your tarantula immediately and give it a day or two for it to harden its fangs before feeding.
        Make sure that all food items, dead or alive, are removed from the enclosure after 24 hours to reduce the risk of unwanted pests like mites as well as preventing mould growth. Furthermore, it is best to avoid leaving live feeders inside the tarantula’s enclosures unattended. Insects like crickets and mealworms can injure or end up eating your spider, mealworms/superworms/dubia roaches are also known to burrow and hide which can be annoying to deal with. Therefore, make sure that the tarantulas eat the live prey instead of dropping them in the enclosure and forgetting about it.

      <h2 class = "description">Additional Remarks    </h2>
        <p class = "prgragraph">  Most tarantula species should never be kept communally, ever. Tarantulas are solitary for the most part in which the only time they come in contact with others of their own kind are when they first hatched or when mating. There are however, a few species like Monocentropus balfouri that can be kept communally from slings till adults as long as the enclosure is large and they are fed frequently.
            A tarantula grows in size by moulting, which will occur every month on average depending on the frequency of feeding, but can sometimes take months. In its final phase when it is about to moult out of its old exoskeleton, tarantulas will flip upside down in order to moult, therefore do not worry and leave them be until they are done. The process usually takes about a day at most and it is ESSENTIAL to not bother them at all, as it could disrupt and stress them out, which can lead to deformities and sometimes death.
